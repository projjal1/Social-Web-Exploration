### Social-Web-Exploration

#### Term:

Social media mining is the process of obtaining big data from user-generated content on social media sites and mobile apps in order to extract patterns, form conclusions about users, and act upon the information, often for the purpose of advertising to users or conducting research.  [Wikipedia]

###### This repository contains notebooks that aim to mine social web to extract useful information about users.<br>
Some of the code in the Jupyter notebook might not work as day to day changes occur in the implementation and usage of Apis.<br>
One can use the code to extract useful information about whats the most trending topics people are engaged in as in case of Twitter mining.<br>
One can extract information about most contributed repo in Github or about a specific user.
Some restrictions appear in case of Facebook as to which some part of Api call might not worked.

##### Note:
I have worked on keeping the code up to date with latest Api procedures.

#### Usage:
Code need to run with Python3 and Jupyter notebook.
